title: "Effect of environmental perturbation in sub-arctic tundra"
excerpt: ""

Global change is predicted to have major impacts on alpine and arctic ecosystems. Plant fitness and growth will be significantly affected by interactions with plants at smaller local scales as well as with interactions with multi-trophic species groups. I am interested in understanding the effects of long-term warming, nutrient addition on species interactions and on plant fitness. Specifically, I am interested in how warming can affect plant-functional traits and how such changes in functional traits can scale up and affect community structure. 
Further, I am also interested in how loss of biodiversity can affect multiple biotic and abiotic ecosystem functions. Of particular intersts is to understand the links between aboveground plants, belowground microbes  and soil mesofauna and how such links get perturbed by global change and scale up to affect biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. This I am working with collaborators from Sweden.
