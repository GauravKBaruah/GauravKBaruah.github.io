**Early warning signals of population decline.**

   I am investigating how populations respond to different environmental perturbations and 
   if there are any early warning signals associated with population regime shifts. 
   To achieve this, I am using a combination of simulation-based modelling approach and 
   experimental methods involving laboratory microcosms. In my current work, 
   I am using a trait-based approach to better quantify and hopefully predict the impact 
   of environmental change on populations and ecological communities. 
   Have a look at [Chris's](http://www.chrisclementsresearch.co.uk/) and [Arpat's](http://www.popecol.org/) webpage.
