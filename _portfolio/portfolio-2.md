title: "Mechanisms behind species coexistence."

I am particularly interested in understanding how species coexist together. Although there have been studies elucidating the mechanisms (stabilizing or equalizing) behind species diversity, yet mechansitic understanding of what factors actually promote species coexistence are still up for debate. Recent theoretical studies on indirect or higher-order interactions have tried to shed light on this issue and have suggested that its only because of such indirect interactions that species can coexist in a large scale. However, such a theory have only shown the ecological side of things, and the evolutionary consequences of such a theory is still missing. I am purely interested in the mathematical side of such a theory but from an evolutionary perspective.
