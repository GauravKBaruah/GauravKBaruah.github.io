  Hi there! I am Gaurav. I am currently a PhD student at University of Zurich particularly interested on investigating how populations respond to different environmental perturbations and 
   if there are  early warning signals associated with population regime shifts. 
   To achieve this, I am using a combination of simulation-based modelling approach and 
   experimental methods involving laboratory microcosms. In my current work, 
   I am using a trait-based approach to better quantify and  predict the impact 
   of environmental change on populations and ecological communities. 
   Have a look at [Chris's](http://www.chrisclementsresearch.co.uk/) and [Arpat's](http://www.popecol.org/) webpage. 
   
   I am also very keen on understanding the mechanisms behind species coexistence, especially the effects of non-additive or higher-order interactions on species dynamics in large communities.
