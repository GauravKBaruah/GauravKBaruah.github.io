**Early warning signals of population decline.**

I am investigating how populations respond to different environmental perturbations and
if there are any early warning signals associated with population regime shifts.
To achieve this, I am using a combination of simulation-based modelling approach and
experimental methods involving laboratory microcosms. In my current work,
I am using a trait-based approach to better quantify and hopefully predict the impact
of environmental change on populations and ecological communities.
Have a look at [Chris's](http://www.chrisclementsresearch.co.uk/) and [Arpat's](http://www.popecol.org/) webpage.



**Mechanisms behind species coexistence**
I am particularly interested in understanding how species coexist together. Although there have been studies elucidating the mechanisms (stabilizing or equalizing) behind species diversity, yet mechansitic understanding of what factors actually promote species coexistence are still up for debate. Recent theoretical studies on indirect or higher-order interactions have tried to shed light on this issue and have suggested that its only because of such indirect interactions that species can coexist in a large scale. However, such a theory have only shown the ecological side of things, and the evolutionary consequences of such a theory is still missing. I am purely interested in the mathematical side of such a theory but from an evolutionary perspective.




**Effect of environmental perturbation in sub-arctic tundra**
Global change is predicted to have major impacts on alpine and arctic ecosystems. Plant fitness and growth will be significantly affected by interactions with plants at smaller local scales as well as with interactions with multi-trophic species groups. I am interested in understanding the effects of long-term warming, nutrient addition on species interactions and on plant fitness. Specifically, I am interested in how warming can affect plant-functional traits and how such changes in functional traits can scale up and affect community structure.
Further, I am also interested in how loss of biodiversity can affect multiple biotic and abiotic ecosystem functions. Of particular intersts is to understand the links between aboveground plants, belowground microbes  and soil mesofauna and how such links get perturbed by global change and scale up to affect biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. This I am working with collaborators from Sweden.
